# swiss-cities-map

Just me trying to make a map of switzerland in the browser where I can interactively display a location on the map.

Now also rewritten in `Svelte`, `Typescript` and using `Bun` for the toolkit.

Main point for this project is pretty simple. I want to be able to point a location on the map in my code, and for some fancy animation and label to appear for the user.
